UEFI Reference Specification Protocol Constants and Definitions

The r-efi project provides the protocol constants and definitions of the
UEFI Reference Specification as native rust code. The scope of this project is
limited to those protocol definitions. The protocols are not actually
implemented. As such, this project serves as base for any UEFI application that
needs to interact with UEFI, or implement (parts of) the UEFI specification.
